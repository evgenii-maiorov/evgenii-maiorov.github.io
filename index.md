# Evgenii Maiorov

Finance PhD (HEC Lausanne / Swiss Finance Institute) working at the intersection of **empirical finance, risk analytics, and NLP**.  
I build research-grade data pipelines (Python/SQL) and run rigorous empirical tests to answer high-stakes questions under constraints.

## What I do
- **Research loop:** data → feature/signal/metric → validation → documentation
- **Tooling:** Python (pandas, statsmodels), SQL, R/Stata, Git, reproducible workflows
- **Focus areas:** firm fundamentals, text analytics (earnings calls / reports), ESG & climate finance, risk monitoring

---

## Selected work 
**Earnings Manipulation Under Pressure (FCPI)**  
- Builds a covenant-pressure proxy and tests links to misstatements / earnings management.  
- Methods: panel regressions, fixed effects, robustness/heterogeneity.

**Words of Conviction (Executive Overconfidence from Text)**  
- NLP framework to measure overconfidence from earnings calls; validated against outcomes.  
- Methods: text features, classification, out-of-sample checks.

**Managerial Consistency (Net-Zero Commitments & Delivery)**  
- Studies valuation effects of commitments vs. delivery relative to firm-specific benchmarks.  
- Methods: selection concerns, identification strategy, robustness.

## Projects 
- **Data pipeline templates:** cleaning + merging large panels; reproducible analysis skeletons.
- **Signal research exercises:** simple alpha tests / feature evaluation framework (backtest hygiene, stability checks).
- **Dashboards:** lightweight monitoring (risk metrics, exposures, summaries).
